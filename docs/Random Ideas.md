To actually start definining some useful things:

Some graph theory

obejcts are nodes
every node has random id
random id seeds Identicons for data subjects

**Obvious:**
Tender
Submitter
Publishing website
Tags
Date published & date due

**Maybe:**
Due date distance (how much time are they giving, not how much is actually left)
ie: when a tender is published Jan 1st and ending Feb 1st, the distance would be 31 days
