# Tender

What are tenders? Basically, a tender is an offer or invitation to bid for a project or to accept a formal offer such as a takeover bid. These tenders are available to the public in the EU and are great ways for small companies and individuals to take advantage of these opportunities. In 2020, Italy alone had over 3 million tenders available ( partially due to the impact of covid). We created Tender, the web app to make these interactions productive, dynamic, and engaging.

## Geography
Tenders are available in several countries in the eu. Their availability obviously depends on the need for this kind of contract work, so you will notice some countries have more opportunities than others. Regardless of country, the user’s data will be saved according to their profile, and the user is able to access all of it with a few clicks.

## Tender Map
This map was designed to make the matching process engaging. The tender map displays the user’s matched tenders based on geographical location. The user is also able to look through their disliked tenders if they want to change their mind on a contract. The tender map was developed based of this force-graph(https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph)  which we found to be a new engaging way for people to interact with data. 

The map was designed with HTML5 Canvas, and uses a force-directed iterative layout. Users are able to zoom,pan, drag nodes and also have several node interactions. As the user swipes on contracts, their data is stored with (insert backend tech) 

## Impact
Tender will revolutionize the way people are able to interact with tenders. This will not only increase accessibility, but also be more enticing for people who don’t like imposing user interfaces. 

graphs are self explanatory ( I think lol)
